- **Game Over & Replay:** When the game ends, you can decide whether you want to play again.
- **Terminal Friendly (Windows Only):** The game works in the terminal but can only be run on Windows.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys:** Moves the snake.
- **WASD Keys:** Another option for controlling the snake.
